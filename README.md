# MATCHER - Manifold Alignment to Characterize Experimental Relationships
**Installation**

MATCHER is on the Python package index (PyPI). To install it using pip, simply type:

        pip install sc-matcher

**MATCHER Input**

MATCHER takes in single cell datasets as Numpy ndarrays (produced by the genfromtxt function in the Numpy package, for example). Each row should contain the measured values for a single cell, and each column should contain the values of a feature across cells. See the sample data files and the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jw156605/MATCHER/blob/master/MATCHER_demo.ipynb) included with the package for more details.
